# Analyze-Market-Review-with-Python
A simple follow along project that was offered via coursera

This project was done in spanish. I was up for the challenge to see if I could follow along in Spanish.

The project is based on reviewing client's reviews of a business. Sentences are taken, words are removed, what is left over is tokenized, and then counted for via count vectorizer

What is accomplsihed on this project was the following:

1) download libraries, read csv file.
2) remove unecessary words
3) Run a count vectorizer and create matrixes
4) take new data and split them to a train and test
5) run machine learning algorithm (Bayes)
6) check for accuracy
7) predict new entry
